I imagine Im a shy blond twink with smooth pale skin whos brought into comedian Heinrichs room to please him. Hes a big, broad-shouldered weed with a jaw that could cut a diamond and big daddy muscles, and Im a skinny, pathetic kid. He pulls me into a kiss and presses my chest against his. He pushed me to the bed and ripped off my pretty virgin panties, which he had been waiting for for a long time. He teases my boipussy with his big thick German cock and then pulls out all the stops: fuck me with a power Ive never felt before. Each thrust makes him moan with pleasure. I like the fact that I give him pleasure. He penetrates deep into my Swedish cilia, slips up my asshole and then squeezes me with his mighty German man arms until I fall asleep on his chest.'
